# Kutai NFT Generator
Kutai NFT Generator is a Random Generative Engine for creating a random generative artworks/collections using Python code. This project idea inspired by [Hashlips Art Engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine.git). This project are trying to solve/add more feature that are not exist in Hashlips Art Engine. I may add more  function/script like "rule" that has logic in it that able to exclude some attributes for being choose.  

Anyway, what I'm trying to do is to make it as simple as possible, so the users with no programming background also able to use it.

Ok, this is what I'm trying to do on this first version:
* Produce some random combination based on artworks input
* Apply the rule/logic
* Make it easy to debug (optional)

Requirements:
---
* Layers
* Probability/Percentage
* Logic (optional)
